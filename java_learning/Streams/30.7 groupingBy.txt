30.7 Grouping elements using the groupingby Collector


-> We can use the groupingBy collector with the collect Method to collect the elements by group

Ex: String[] names = {"John", "Peter", "Susan", "Kim", "Jen", 
 "George", "Alan", "Stacy", "Steve", "john"}; 
Map<Character, Long> map = Stream.of(names).collect(
 Collectors.groupingBy(e âˆ’> e.charAt(0), Collectors.counting()));

+, The first argument in the groupingBy method specifies the criteria for grouping, known as a classifier. 
+, The second argument specifies how the elements in a group are processed, known as a group processor.
