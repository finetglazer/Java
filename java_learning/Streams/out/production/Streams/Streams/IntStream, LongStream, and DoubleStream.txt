3. IntStream, LongStream, and DoubleStream

-> are special types of streams for processing a sequence of primitive int, long, and double values.

These streams are also subinterfaces of BaseStream.
=> Can use the same way as a Stream.
Additionally, u can use sum(), average(), and summaryStatistics() methods.

+ System.out.println("The average of distinct even numbers > 3: " + IntStream.of(values).distinct().filter(e âˆ’> e > 3 && e % 2 == 0).average().getAsDouble());

-> nothing new just getAsDouble() is method of OptionalDouble class 

+ System.out.println("The sum of the first 4 numbers is " + IntStream.of(values).limit(4).sum());
-> do not need get() coz it is not in Optional class

+ String[] names = {"John", "Peter", "Susan", "Kim", "Jen",
                "George", "Alan", "Stacy", "Michelle", "john"};

     System.out.println("Total character count for all names is " + Stream.of(names).mapToInt(e -> e.length()).sum());

-> maps t into a value of the type int. 

+ System.out.println("The number of digits in array values is " +
                Stream.of(values).map(e -> e + "")
                        .mapToInt(e -> e.length()).sum());
-> create a stream by mapping into String after that sum the length() of each string.
