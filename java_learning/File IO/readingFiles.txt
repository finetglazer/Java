2 main ways, choose 1

1. Reading data using Scanner

    It is possible to use java.util.Scanner to read data from files.

    First of all, we need to create an instance of java.io.File and then an instance of Scanner passing the file object. 
    After that, we can get data from the file by using the scanner in the same way as we read from the standard input.

    Suppose you have a string called pathToFile. 
    It keeps the path to a file that contains a sequence of numbers separated by spaces.

    Ex: 
         
        File file = new File(pathToFile);
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(file); // it throws FileNotFoundException (checked)

    This code reads each line from the file and outputs it to the standard output.
        while (scanner.hasNext()) {
            System.out.print(scanner.nextLine());
        }
            first line
            second line
            third line
        -> first line second line third line

2. Reading all text from a file as a single string

    Coz it is String so I dont want to learn
