if a variable name is a single word it should be in lowercase (for instance: number, price);
if a variable name includes multiple words it should be in lowerCamelCase, i.e. the first word should be in lowercase and each word after the first should have its first letter written in uppercase (for instance: numberOfCoins);
variable names should not start with _ and $ characters, although they are allowed;
choose a name that makes sense, e.g. score makes more sense than s, although they are both valid.
