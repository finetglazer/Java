1. Fundamental
    An object’s current state is represented by its fields,
    An object’s behavior is represented by its methods.
2. Basic principles
    encapsulation: trans data into the one
    data abstracton: make easier to use
    inheritance: can use pass down
    polymorphism: use some obj have the same title but some different atributions
3. Obj
    In pogram, everything can be a obj, ex: class.
    -> pogram is interact between objects
    sometimes, objs dont have the atribute and methods
4. class
    Often, many individual objects have similar characteristics.
    We can say these objects belong to the same type or class.
    ex: 
    class house has the same atribute:
        + floors
        + year
        ...
    class plane :
        + name
        + speed
        + nums possible can pass
        ...
