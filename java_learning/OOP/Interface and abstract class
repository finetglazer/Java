1. Def
  + Interface: is contract which saves the methods but just the signature not actions. All classes implementing interface must implements all methods
  + Abstract class: is a class that contains both abstract and  concrete methods. It serves as a base class for other classes. 

2. Mulitple inheritance: 
  Interface supports multiple interface inheritance, and abstract class only be inheritted form one class.

3. Constructor
  Interface do not have constructor and abstract class have.

4. Fields
  + Interface: Can only have constants (public static final fields)
  + Abstract class: Can have fields with many access modifiers

5. Use Cases:
   I1           I2         I3                              Abstract class
_______     ________    _______                               / | \
|     |     |      |    |      |                             /   |  \
  \              |          /                               /    |   \
   \             |         /                               /     |    \
    \            |        /                           CLASS1   CLASS2  CLASS3    
          CLASS

Special case: interface can inherit many interfaces.
