In Java, you can use several methods to check if a character is a number or an alphanumeric digit (a letter or a number). Here are a couple of common approaches:

1. **Using Character.isDigit() and Character.isLetter():**

   You can use the `Character.isDigit(char c)` method to check if a character is a digit, and `Character.isLetter(char c)` to check if it's a letter. Here's an example:

   ```java
   char ch = '5';

   if (Character.isDigit(ch)) {
       System.out.println("It's a digit.");
   } else if (Character.isLetter(ch)) {
       System.out.println("It's a letter.");
   } else {
       System.out.println("It's neither a digit nor a letter.");
   }
   ```

2. **Using Regular Expressions:**

   Regular expressions can be powerful for more complex character pattern matching. You can use the `matches()` method with a regular expression pattern to check if a character matches your criteria. For example, to check if a character is a digit or an alphanumeric character:

   ```java
   char ch = '5';

   if (String.valueOf(ch).matches("[0-9]")) {
       System.out.println("It's a digit.");
   } else if (String.valueOf(ch).matches("[a-zA-Z0-9]")) {
       System.out.println("It's an alphanumeric character.");
   } else {
       System.out.println("It's neither a digit nor an alphanumeric character.");
   }
   ```

   In this example, `"[0-9]"` matches any digit, and `"[a-zA-Z0-9]"` matches any alphanumeric character.

Choose the method that best suits your specific requirements and the complexity of your character checking task.
